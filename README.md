Introduction to Strapi
Strapi is a headless CMS (Content Management System), which means it allows developers to manage and deliver content across different platforms, such as websites, mobile apps, or other digital devices, without being tied to a specific frontend.

Think of Strapi as a tool to:

Store content (like articles, products, or user data).
Customize APIs (so other apps or websites can use this content).
Control how and where this content is delivered (websites, apps, or even chatbots).
Why Use Strapi?
Control Over Data

With Strapi, you are in charge of where and how your data is stored. You don't need to rely on third-party services—you can host your data wherever you want.
Flexible Hosting Options

You can host your Strapi project on any platform:
Cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku
Static hosting services like Netlify
Your own server or VPS (Virtual Private Server)
Database Freedom

Strapi works with multiple databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, or SQLite, allowing you to choose the one you’re comfortable with or already using.
Highly Customizable

Strapi gives you complete control over how your APIs work. You can modify routes, plugins, and functionality to match your project’s needs.

Reporting Documentation Issues
If you find mistakes in the documentation (such as broken screenshots, wrong instructions, or incorrect code samples), you can help us by reporting them:

Verify the issue is related to the documentation, not the product itself (e.g., missing product features should be reported to the main repository).
Report Issues: Use the documentation issue template.
For product-related issues, please report them at Strapi’s main repository.

If you run into challenges or need further assistance, here are several ways to get help:

Documentation Updates and Release Schedule
Strapi documentation follows a continuous delivery model, meaning updates can happen multiple times a day. Each Wednesday, a weekly release is published, summarizing all recent changes. You can view the latest release notes here.

Code of Conduct
Strapi believes in fostering a positive and inclusive community. All participants must adhere to the Strapi Code of Conduct.

Versioning System
Starting with Strapi 5, the documentation version is no longer synchronized with the product version. The documentation is now treated as a separate product and follows its own versioning system.

Summary
Strapi is an open-source headless CMS that offers developers the freedom to build and customize APIs, choose their hosting environment, and manage their data independently. It provides excellent documentation and an active community to support developers of all levels.

If you’re new to Strapi or want to dive deeper, explore the official documentation or connect with other users through the community forum or Discord.

This version provides clear explanations of technical terms, makes navigation easier, and ensures that users of all levels can understand the content effortlessly.
